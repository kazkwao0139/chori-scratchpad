  "info_density_reasoning": "The dialogue is generally purposeful, with most lines advancing plot, establishing world rules (Gates, worms, Keystones, Closers), or developing character relationships. However, there are stretches of repetitive emotional beats (Suzume calling for Souta repeatedly, multiple 'what's happening' exchanges) and some filler in travel sequences. The exposition about Closer mythology is efficient, and character-defining moments (Tamaki's parking lot outburst, Suzume's confrontation with her child self) are sharp. The density suffers slightly from necessary but repetitive quest structure dialogue and some overwrought emotional repetition in climactic scenes.",

  "payoff_setups": "Chair as mother's memento → revealed she built it, becomes vessel for time travel encounter; Tamaki's sacrifice narrative → parking lot confession and resolution; Daijin as antagonist → revealed as guide opening doors intentionally; Two Keystones mythology → both deployed in climax; Suzume getting lost as child → literal return to that moment; Souta's teacher exam → abandoned for quest, character cost; 'You're my daughter' line → Tamaki doesn't remember saying it, emotional crux; Eternal Night established early → becomes setting for climax; Three-legged chair mystery → never fully resolved but thematically consistent; Tokyo Gate from 100 years ago → final battleground",
  "payoff_reasoning": "The script demonstrates strong setup-payoff discipline. Major story elements introduced early (the chair's origin, Suzume's childhood trauma, the dual Keystone system, the Eternal Night) all receive meaningful payoffs. The emotional through-line of Suzume's relationship with Tamaki is established, complicated, and resolved. Daijin's seemingly antagonistic behavior is recontextualized as guidance. The chair being made by her mother pays off both literally (the time-loop encounter) and thematically. Some minor setups lack complete resolution (why exactly three legs, Serizawa's debt reversal feels convenient), and the mechanics of how Suzume enters the Eternal Night the second time are somewhat hand-waved, but overall the narrative architecture is solid.",

  "balance_reasoning": "Makoto Shinkai films are known for being highly visual with extensive atmospheric sequences, montages, and visual storytelling. The actual film contains long sequences of Suzume traveling, visual spectacle of the worm and gates, detailed background animation of locations, and emotional beats conveyed through imagery and Radwimps' score. This dialogue-only transcript represents roughly 35% of the storytelling—the film relies heavily on Shinkai's signature visual language (sky imagery, light effects, landscape transitions, character expressions). The balance is excellent for the medium: dialogue handles exposition and character efficiently while leaving space for the director's visual strengths. The script trusts the visuals to carry emotional weight, particularly in fantastical sequences.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This is a competently structured adventure-fantasy screenplay that balances mythological world-building with intimate character drama. The dialogue efficiently establishes rules while maintaining emotional stakes, and the script demonstrates strong thematic cohesion around loss, memory, and connection. The weakness lies in some repetitive emotional beats during climactic moments and the occasional over-reliance on characters asking 'what's happening' during supernatural events. The time-loop resolution with young Suzume is the script's strongest moment, earning its emotional weight through careful setup. The screenplay understands it's working in a visual medium and keeps dialogue functional rather than literary, which is appropriate for Shinkai's directorial style.",
