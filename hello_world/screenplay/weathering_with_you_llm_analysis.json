  "info_density_reasoning": "The dialogue carries substantial narrative weight throughout, establishing Hodaka's runaway status, Hina's supernatural ability, the central romance, and the escalating consequences of weather manipulation. However, there's noticeable repetition in emotional beats (multiple 'I don't want to go back' moments, repeated assertions about the weather being abnormal), and some exchanges serve primarily atmospheric purposes rather than advancing plot. The business setup of the 'sunshine girl' service is efficiently handled, and the police investigation thread is economically introduced. The ratio of plot-essential to decorative dialogue is solid but not exceptional.",
  "payoff_rate": 81,
  "payoff_setups": "Gun introduction (Hodaka finds it) → fired at climax; Hina's transparency/fading → sacrifice; 'Tokyo was originally sea' → final acceptance; Suga's daughter/custody battle → character motivation; Nagi's precocious dating advice → comic relief payoff; The rooftop shrine torii → portal for both becoming and rescue; Hina's lie about age (18 vs 15) → legal complications; Initial hamburger kindness → relationship foundation; Suga saving Hodaka on ferry → debt/relationship; 'Power requires sacrifice' warning → Hina's disappearance; Sky fish imagery → otherworld confirmation; Mother's death/hospital → Hina's prayer origin; The ring → birthday gift payoff",
  "payoff_reasoning": "The screenplay demonstrates strong structural discipline with most major setups receiving clear payoffs. The gun is introduced early and becomes pivotal in the climax. Hina's gradual transparency directly leads to her sacrifice. The historical exposition about Tokyo being underwater pays off thematically in the flooded ending. Character arcs like Suga's custody battle and his parallel to Hodaka resolve meaningfully. The age deception creates genuine legal stakes. However, some elements feel under-explored: the sky fish remain mostly visual metaphor without deeper integration, and certain secondary characters (Natsumi's job hunt, some of Nagi's girlfriends) serve more as texture than structured narrative. The mythology around 'weather maidens' is introduced but remains somewhat vague in its mechanics, though this ambiguity may be intentional.",

  "balance_reasoning": "Makoto Shinkai's films are renowned for their visual storytelling, and Weathering with You exemplifies this approach. The actual film contains extensive sequences of pure visual narrative: the ferry journey opening, Hina's prayer transforming to sky imagery, the elaborate weather-clearing montages, the climactic sky realm sequences with minimal dialogue, and the three-year time jump conveyed largely through environmental changes. The dialogue transcript represents only the verbal component of a heavily direction-driven film. Emotional beats are carried through animation quality, weather symbolism, and Radwimps' musical integration. The balance is exceptional because dialogue is used for character intimacy and plot mechanics while direction handles theme, atmosphere, and the fantastical elements that define the film's identity.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This is competent commercial anime screenwriting with clear three-act structure, efficient character establishment, and strong visual-narrative integration typical of Shinkai's work. The dialogue effectively balances exposition with emotional authenticity, particularly in the teenage voices. The central conceit—weather manipulation with personal cost—is introduced, explored, and resolved with thematic coherence. Weaknesses include some redundant emotional restatements and occasional reliance on coincidence (multiple chance encounters). The romantic core works because it's grounded in mutual rescue rather than pure attraction. The script trusts its visual medium, keeping dialogue sparse during key spectacle moments, and the ending's ambiguity (world permanently changed, but lovers reunited) demonstrates mature storytelling that resists easy resolution.",
