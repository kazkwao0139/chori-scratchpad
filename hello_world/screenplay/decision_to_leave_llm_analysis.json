  "info_density_reasoning": "The screenplay is remarkably economical, with nearly every scene advancing plot, character, or thematic concerns. Visual storytelling dominates—objects like the Rolex watch, green notebook, and phone passwords serve multiple narrative functions. Some repetitive surveillance sequences and overlapping interrogation scenes slightly reduce efficiency, but the script generally avoids filler.",
  "payoff_rate": 85,
  "payoff_setups": "Seo-rae's self-harm scratches → explained as communication method with abusive husband; Green 'Sanhaegyeong' notebook → becomes her Korean study tool and final burial object; Hae-jun's insomnia → resolved through Seo-rae's breathing technique, then returns when separated; 'Decision to Leave' title → paid off in mountain/sea duality and final burial choice; Rolex watch with cracked face → transfers to second husband, links cases; Pентанил capsules → set up with mother's euthanasia, paid off in final suicide; 'Deliberate/majestic' mistranslation → becomes romantic callback; Hae-jun's meticulous pocket organization → contrasts with emotional chaos; Phone passwords as dates → 150724 becomes key emotional anchor; 'You were beautiful' photo → echoes across timeline",
  "payoff_reasoning": "Park Chan-wook demonstrates exceptional structural discipline. Nearly every planted detail—from the artificial tears to the climbing route research to the barbecue grill—receives payoff. The green notebook, insomnia cure, and phone recording create a tight thematic lattice. A few minor setups (the son Hajoo's subplot, some supporting characters) remain underdeveloped, but the central mystery architecture is masterful.",

  "balance_rating": 9,
  "balance_reasoning": "The heavy direction bias is entirely appropriate for this visual noir thriller. Park's camera becomes a character—surveillance angles, close-ups of hands and objects, and meticulously described blocking convey subtext that dialogue cannot. The sparse, often mistranslated dialogue creates intimacy through gaps rather than exposition. This ratio serves the story's obsessive watching/being-watched themes perfectly.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This is master-level screenwriting that trusts visual storytelling over verbal exposition. The structure employs a sophisticated flashback/present weave without confusion, using costume and hair changes as temporal markers. Character revelation occurs through action (Seo-rae burning evidence, Hae-jun's pocket rituals) rather than speeches. The script's bilingual dimension—using translation apps and mistranslations as both plot device and metaphor for connection/disconnection—is brilliantly integrated. Minor weaknesses include some redundant surveillance montages and occasional over-specification of camera angles that might limit directorial interpretation, but these are trivial against the screenplay's architectural achievements. The ending's ambiguity (is burial murder or assisted suicide?) demonstrates confident restraint.",
