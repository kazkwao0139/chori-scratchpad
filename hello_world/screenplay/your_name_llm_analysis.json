  "info_density_reasoning": "The dialogue transcript shows strong narrative efficiency typical of anime screenwriting. Most lines advance plot (body-swapping mechanics, comet disaster, temporal displacement), character relationships, or thematic elements (musuhi, connection across time). However, there are repetitive sequences (name forgetting loops, multiple 'who are you?' exchanges) and some redundant explanatory dialogue that could be tightened. The body-swap confusion comedy, while character-building, occasionally lingers beyond narrative necessity. Still, the dialogue density is above average because nearly every exchange either reveals crucial information (the 3-year time gap, the disaster, the musuhi philosophy) or deepens emotional stakes.",

  "payoff_setups": "Braided cord/musuhi philosophy → time connection mechanism; Kuchikamizake ritual → means for Taki to reach Mitsuha's time; 'Kataware-doki' twilight → the crucial meeting moment; Father leaving shrine/politics → obstacle and resolution for evacuation; Comet appearing beautiful → becomes the disaster; Hair ribbon → physical connection object across time; 'Your name?' question → climactic memory loss; Evacuation plan details → executed payoff; Forest fire/explosion plan → carried out; Writing names on hands → subverted with 'I love you'",
  "payoff_reasoning": "The screenplay demonstrates sophisticated setup/payoff architecture. The musuhi concept introduced early becomes the metaphysical explanation for body-swapping and time travel. The ritual sake is planted scenes before it becomes the solution. 'Kataware-doki' is established linguistically before becoming the pivotal meeting window. The comet's beauty is emphasized throughout before revealing its catastrophic role. The father's political position, initially presented as family drama, becomes essential to the evacuation solution. Minor setups also pay off: Tessie's construction knowledge, Sayaka's broadcast skills, the topography discussions. The name-forgetting motif escalates throughout and reaches its emotional crescendo. A few elements feel slightly under-utilized (some secondary character details), but the core narrative threads are woven with remarkable precision.",

  "balance_reasoning": "Makoto Shinkai's 'Your Name' is renowned for its visual storytelling—breathtaking landscapes, body language during swaps, the comet's visual presence, montage sequences with music. The actual film likely contains extensive periods of pure visual narrative: the transformation sequences, Tokyo cityscapes, rural Itomori atmosphere, the comet split and impact visualization, the final searching montage across seasons. Dialogue serves to clarify the complex temporal mechanics and emotional states, but the film's emotional impact derives heavily from Shinkai's trademark visual poetry. This transcript represents only spoken words, missing perhaps 60-70% of the storytelling that occurs through animation, lighting, composition, and RADWIMPS' musical integration. The balance is nearly ideal for this medium—dialogue handles necessary exposition and intimacy while visuals carry atmosphere, time passage, and symbolic weight.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This screenplay demonstrates exceptional structural complexity for an animated feature, managing parallel timelines, body-swap mechanics, and disaster-prevention plotting while maintaining emotional clarity. The dialogue efficiently handles heavy exposition (time displacement, musuhi philosophy, disaster mechanics) without feeling leaden, largely through character-specific voice and emotional urgency. The cyclical 'forgetting' motif creates narrative tension while reinforcing thematic concerns about memory and connection. Weaknesses include some repetitive confusion sequences and occasionally on-the-nose explanatory dialogue. The climactic act shows masterful convergence of planted elements. The dialogue-to-direction ratio reflects Shinkai's visual-first approach—words clarify what images evoke, creating a synergistic relationship between verbal and visual storytelling that defines modern anime at its best.",
