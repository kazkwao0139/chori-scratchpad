  "info_density_reasoning": "The dialogue carries immense narrative weight, establishing the NERV invasion, Third Impact mechanics, and character psychologies. However, Evangelion's style includes intentional repetition (Asuka's 'I don't want to die' loop, Shinji's repeated pleas) and abstract psychological sequences that trade conventional efficiency for thematic resonance. Lines like 'What is your wish?' and the extensive introspective monologues serve philosophical exploration rather than pure plot advancement. The technical exposition (MAGI hacking, AT Field discussions) is dense and functional, while the psychological segments are deliberately circular, reflecting mental states rather than advancing story beats linearly.",

  "payoff_setups": "Misato's kiss promise/final kiss; Asuka's mother in EVA-02 (established in TV series, paid off in battle awakening); Shinji's hospital desperation/final beach scene; Rei's autonomy/rejection of Gendo; Lilith/Adam fusion; Instrumentality as escape/rejection of it; 'I'm the lowest' masturbation scene/final 'disgusting'; AT Fields as心の壁/their dissolution and restoration; Gendo's isolation/death alone; Ritsuko's betrayal setup/CASPER choosing Gendo",
  "payoff_reasoning": "The film operates as a culmination of the entire series, paying off setups from 26 episodes plus prior film. Nearly every major element resolves: Shinji's wish for unity vs. individuality, Asuka's mother trauma, Rei's agency, Gendo's plan, SEELE's intentions, the nature of Evas and AT Fields. The 'disgusting' final line pays off the opening hospital scene's self-loathing. Misato's death pays off her guardian role. The psychological sequences, while abstract, systematically address each character relationship Shinji fears. Minor deduction for some setups (Kaji's watermelons, certain side characters) getting minimal resolution, but the core narrative architecture is remarkably tight given its scope.",

  "balance_reasoning": "The actual film features extensive visual storytelling: the 7-minute live-action Instrumentality sequence, lengthy combat scenes with minimal dialogue, the surreal Mass Production EVA battle, abstract imagery during Third Impact, and apocalyptic montages. The invasion sequence relies heavily on military action and visual chaos. The final beach scene is nearly silent. However, Anno balances this with dense dialogue in key moments—Misato's speeches, the psychological confrontations, technical briefings. The direction carries the emotional and philosophical weight through imagery (crosses, religious symbolism, body horror), while dialogue anchors character interiority. This creates a synergistic relationship rather than competition, typical of Anno's style where neither element is subordinate.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This screenplay demonstrates advanced structural complexity, using a theatrical film format to resolve a TV series while functioning as standalone apocalyptic cinema. The craft lies in balancing three simultaneous narratives (military invasion, metaphysical Third Impact, psychological introspection) that converge thematically. Dialogue shifts registers from technical military jargon to abstract philosophy to raw emotional confession without losing coherence. The repetition is purposeful, mirroring trauma and mental loops. Character voices remain distinct even in surreal contexts. The script trusts visual storytelling for action while using dialogue to excavate interiority that images alone cannot convey. Its greatest strength is thematic density—nearly every line connects to the central question of individual identity versus collective unity, loneliness versus connection.",
