  "info_density_reasoning": "The screenplay is remarkably efficient, with nearly every scene serving multiple purposes—advancing plot, deepening class commentary, and building character. While some sequences (like the pizza box folding or the drunk man at the window) might seem tangential, they establish the Kim family's desperate circumstances and living conditions. Very little feels indulgent; even seemingly minor details (peach allergy, viewing stone, the smell) pay off significantly.",
  "payoff_rate": 91,
  "payoff_setups": "Viewing stone (gift→survival tool→attempted weapon→final symbol), peach allergy (casual mention→weaponized twice), Morse code (Cub Scouts→Da-Song's discovery→Ki-Tek's communication), the smell/line-crossing (repeated commentary→murder trigger), belt of trust montage (family infiltration strategy), basement bunker (architectural detail→major plot engine), rain/flooding (weather→class metaphor→catastrophe), Da-Song's first trauma (mysterious backstory→revealed as seeing ghost→seizure trigger), Jessica's panties (plant→Yun's firing→driver replacement), motion-sensor lights (mundane detail→Morse code device)",
  "payoff_reasoning": "The screenplay demonstrates exceptional setup discipline. Nearly every planted element—from the stone Min-Hyuk gives Ki-Woo to Mun-Kwang's tuberculosis lie to the specific smell Dong-Ik notices—returns with dramatic or thematic weight. The Morse code setup in particular spans the entire narrative (Cub Scouts→lights blinking→final letter). Only minor elements like some party guests or certain background details lack direct payoff, but they serve atmospheric purposes.",

  "balance_rating": 9,
  "balance_reasoning": "The ratio heavily favors visual storytelling, which is perfectly appropriate for this cinematic thriller. Bong Joon-ho uses action lines not just for blocking but for precise visual storytelling (the tracking shots, the symbolic geography of up/down). The dialogue is sharp and efficient, never expository for its own sake. The balance allows the film's visual class metaphors (basement vs. hilltop, flooding, light/dark) to carry equal weight with verbal commentary.",
  "overall_craft_notes": "This is masterclass-level screenplay architecture. The structure uses a deceptive three-act framework (infiltration comedy→discovery horror→chaotic tragedy) while maintaining thematic coherence about class, smell, and 'crossing the line.' Every tonal shift is earned through setup. The visual writing is specific without being controlling—'bloodshot eyes,' 'motion-sensor lights,' 'crane formation'—giving directors clear imagery while allowing interpretation. The interweaving of multiple plot threads (the Kims' con, the bunker couple, Da-Song's trauma, the mounting class resentment) never loses control. Minor weaknesses: some late expository voiceover feels slightly less elegant than the showing-not-telling of earlier acts, and the extended dream sequence ending risks sentimentality, though it serves the thematic gut-punch. The screenplay trusts its visual storytelling and respects audience intelligence—hallmarks of sophisticated cinema.",
